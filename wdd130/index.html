      <h2>Puebla, Mexico</h2>
      <img src="images/Puebla.png" alt="Puebla">
      <p>Puebla, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Puebla, is one of the 31 states that, along with Mexico City, comprise the Federal Entities of Mexico. It is divided into 217 municipalities and its capital is Puebla City. Part of east-central Mexico, it is bordered by the states of Veracruz to the north and east, Hidalgo, MÃ©xico, Tlaxcala and Morelos to the west, and Guerrero and Oaxaca to the south. Today, the state is one of the most industrialized in the country, but since most of its development is concentrated in Puebla and other cities, many of its rural areas are undeveloped.</p>
